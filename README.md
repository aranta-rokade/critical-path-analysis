# critical-path-analysis

Performs Critical Path Analysis on a Event Node Graph
The program calculates the Earliest Completion Time(ECT), Latest Completion Time(LCT) and Slack of Milestones and Activities
Prints out the critical path of the graph.

Currently the program uses a static graph. I plan to extend the code by allowing user input and performing topological sort on the graph.
